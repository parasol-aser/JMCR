<h1><a name="whatr"></a>What is a Resource?</h1>
The Resources are the objects exported by <b>Jigsaw</b> to the outside world. Resources can generate raw data stream, like text files or image files, or they can be active objects, generating data stream on the fly, depending on different contexts, like servlets, cgi scripts, filtered resources.

<p>Inside <b>Jigsaw</b>, a resource is a full Java object, containing only information that the raw Resource (a file, a directory...) can provide (eg, for a file, the size, last modification date...)</p>

<p>To be available on the server, a resource <b>MUST</b> be associated with a ProtocolFrame implementing the protocol available on that particular server. An instance of Jigsaw (ie: the java process) can support multiple servers, each server having the possibility of implementing different protocols and may or may not share the same set of resources.

<p>The list of all <a href="../Reference/resources.html">Resources</a> is
available.</p>

<h1><a name="whatf"></a>What is a Frame?</h1>
Since Jigsaw-2.0, the Resources are very basic and contains only the intrinsic
knowledge of this resource. For file, you have the size, last modification
date... The 2.0 Resources have protocol frames. Those frames are handling the
different protocols used to fetch this particular resource.

<p>A Frame is a full Java Object, containing all the information needed to
serve this Resource using a specific Protocol (eg, HTTPFrame for
<b>HTTP</b>).</p>

<p>The list of all <a href="../Reference/frames.html">Frames</a> is
available.</p>

<center>
<img src="resframe.gif" alt="Resources and frames" height="300" width="498">
</center>

<h1><a name="whatfi"></a>What is a Filter?</h1>
The filters alters the resources, by requesting authentification for example.
The filters are attached to the resource. In the 2.0 version the filters are
atteched to the protocol frame of the resource rather than to the resource
itself because many filtering scheme depends on the protocol used, the
authentification in HTTP is very specific to HTTP  and can't be used in other
protocols. The filters are called before and after serving the resource. You
may have filters that are called only before the resource is served, like an
authentification filter, or after, like a "find and replace" filter.

<p>A Filter is a full Java Object, associated to a Frame, that can modify the
Request and/or the Reply. For example the Authentication is handled by a
special filter, the <a
href="../Reference/org.w3c.jigsaw.auth.GenericAuthFilter.html">GenericAuthFilter</a>
(Note, as this filter is protocol dependant, it is placed on the protocol
frame).</p>

<p>The list of all <a
href="../Reference/frames.html#Filter+frames">Filters</a> is available.</p>

<h1><a name="indexer"></a>What is an Indexer ?</h1>
There are two ways of configuring the resources, by adding directly a specific
resource at a specific place, or by letting the indexers create the resource
in the server hierarchy. Of course the manual tune can be used along with the
indexers. That is the most common way to configure <b>Jigsaw</b>. <a
name="indexers"></a>

<p>An indexers, placed on a Container, will be in charge of creating its sons
resources. It will create Resource of a special kind depending, for example,
on the extension of the filename ("html" for an html page, "png" for a PNG
image file....). Or place a specific indexer for cgi on a directory named
"cgi-bin". In Jigsaw-2.0, the indexer is not only in charge of creating the
resource, it has also to put the right protocol frames (and other frames if
necessary) on the created resource.</p>

<p>An indexer have two main part:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Directories.</li>
  <li>The Extensions.</li>
</ol>
In the Directories, you have to specify how to index directories with a
specific name. The default name is "*default*", in the default indexer the
resource created is a DirectoryResource. In the 2.0 version, it creates a
DirectoryResource with a default HTTPFrame.

<p>In the extensions, you have to specify how to index files or leaf
Resources. The default extension are mapped to FileResource, html, gif, png,
txt... In the 2.0 version, an HTTPFrame is added to the Resource.</p>

<p>A tutorial about the <a href="../User/indexers.html">setup of indexers
</a>is available, it helps understanding how it works.</p>

<h1><a name="resource"></a>The new Resource</h1>
In the previous version of <b>Jigsaw</b> (1.0), the inheritance tree of
Resources was:

<center>
<img src="olddesign.gif" alt="Sketches of the old design">
</center>

<p>All the basic Resources, such as FileResource and DirectoryResource, were
heavily linked to HTTP as all the resources served were extensions protocols
that are not HTTP-related, we propose this new version of the Resource:</p>

<center>
<img src="resource.gif" alt="basic resource with frames">
</center>

<p>Where (1) and (2) are ResourceFrames. A Resource is now a very basic thing,
containing only information that the raw Resource can provide (e.g., for a
file, the size, last modification date, creation date if available, etc.),
then, attached to that Resource, we find the ResourceFrames that extend
Resource (they are handled the same way) and contain information about the
Resource they are attached to.</p>

<p>To serve a resource using a protocol -- for instance, HTTP -- the Resource
will have a protocol ResourceFrame, HTTPFrame, that contains all the
information needed to serve this Resource using HTTP. This frame is like the
old version of HTTPResource, but it contains more information than the
previous version.</p>

<p>The filters are now divided in two categories: the filters on the Resource
and the filters on the protocol Frames. The usual filtering scheme used in the
previous version of <b>Jigsaw</b> is still valid. The main difference is that
filters are no longer attached to the Resource itself but to its protocol
frame. ResourceFrames can also have frames.</p>

<p>Other kind of frames can be attached, like RDF frame for metadata, PICS
frame to rate this resource, etc...</p>

<p>The new inheritance tree is:</p>

<p>more complex, but more flexible than the previous version.</p>

<h1><a name="manager"></a>The new ResourceStoreManager</h1>
In order to share all the Resources amongst different servers efficiently, we
created a new central ResourceStoreManager. In the previous version the
Resources were handled by other Resources. For example, the FileResource was
handled by its DirectoryResource. This induced a number of bugs and was not
very well-adapted to the new way of sharing Resources. There is now only one
manager for the server handler so that each server will talk to this sole
manager.

<center>
<img src="rsm.gif" alt="resource manager drawing">
</center>

<p>This RSM contains a hashtable associating a key (unique indentifier of a
ResourceContainer) and a StoreEntry. The StoreEntry contains the store of the
resource sons and a hashtable associating the identifier of the sons of the
resource and the ResourceReference of those resources.</p>

<p>The ResourceReference is used like this:</p>
<pre>  ResourceReference rr;
  ....
  try {
     Resource res = rr.lock();
     ....
  } catch (InvalidResourceException ex) {
    /* InvalidResource means that the resource has been deleted */
     ....
  } finally {
    rr.unlock();
  }
  ...</pre>
If the resource has been garbage-collected, the rr.lock() will load it again,
and during the lock, it is guaranteed that the resource won't be deleted,
unloaded or modified by someone else. This allows safe concurrent modification
access to this resource.

<p>Now the container is no longer responsible for the management of its son;
it only has a key to the StoreEntry, which contains its sons. To get its own
store, the resource has to ask its parent for the StoreEntry that contains
it.</p>

<h1><a name="lookup-algo"></a>The lookup and perform algorithm</h1>
