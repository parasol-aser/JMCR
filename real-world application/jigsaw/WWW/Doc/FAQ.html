You think your question about <b>Jigsaw</b> is worth entering this list, you
have a better formulation for some of the answers ? Mail to <a
href="mailto:jigsaw@w3.org">jigsaw@w3.org</a> !

<h2><a name="purpose"></a>What's the purpose of <b>Jigsaw</b> ?</h2>
<b>Jigsaw</b> is the new W3C reference server. Its main purpose is to
demonstrate new protocol features as they are defined (such as <a
href="/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</a> or <a href="/PICS/">PICS</a>), and to provide
the basis for experimentations in the field of server software (such as the
provided MUX prototypical implementation).

<h2><a name="download"></a>Where can I get <b>Jigsaw</b> ?</h2>
You can download <b>Jigsaw</b> distribution file in various formats, and using
either ftp or http:
<dl>
  <dt>Windows zip files (1.5Mo)</dt>
    <dd><ul>
        <li><a href="ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/jigsaw/jigsaw.zip">FTP</a></li>
        <li><a
        href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/jigsaw.zip">HTTP</a></li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  <dt>UNIX gzip tar file (700Ko)</dt>
    <dd><ul>

        <li><a
        href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/jigsaw.tar.gz">HTTP</a></li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="java"></a>Why is <b>Jigsaw</b> written in Java ?</h2>
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com/">Java</a> has a number of advantages that
fit well with our purposes. It provides portable threads and garbage
collection, allows for a very dynamic server architecture. It's ability to
move code around may be use in future development to experiment with the
mobile code concept.

<h2><a name="slow"></a><b>Jigsaw</b> is written in Java, it must be really
slow...</h2>
No so true ! Check out the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Jigsaw/User/Introduction/performance.html">performance
evaluation of <b>Jigsaw</b></a>, which indicates that it performs at least as
well as the CERN server.

<h2><a name="Method-GET"></a>The admin server reply "Method GET not
implemented.", how can I use it?</h2>
The administration server does not use plain HTTP but a variant of it. The
only tool available for now is an application called <a
href="User/AdminTools.html">JigAdmin</a>.

<h2><a name="jigsaw-indexing"></a>What is this <i>indexing</i> thing all about
?</h2>
To a normal HTTP web-admin, <b>Jigsaw</b>'s configuration process might look
really strange...<a href="Programmer/design.html"><b>Jigsaw</b>'s design</a>
emphasis two different processing stage in serving documents:
<dl>
  <dt>Indexing stage</dt>
    <dd>When documents <i>enter</i> the Web</dd>
  <dt>Serving stage</dt>
    <dd>When documents are served to clients</dd>
</dl>
In short the rationale for separating these two stages is to make the
<i>serving stage</i> as efficient as possible, by having the <i>indexing
stage</i> prepare as much as possible the work. A document <i>enter</i> the
WEB space the first time <b>Jigsaw</b> serves it; this happen behind the scene
most of the time, and consist in creating a <i>resource</i> for the document
to be served by querying a <i>resource factory</i>. The current resource
factory can be configured to create various kind of resources based either on
the file name extensions, or (in case of a directory) based on its name.

<p>However, once a resource is created, it no longer reflects the settings of
the resource factory (see the <a href="User/indexers.html">indexers</a>); in
some sense the information gets <i>compiled</i> so that at serving time,
processing overhead is reduced as much as possible.</p>

<h2><a name="pass-directory"></a>How do I tie a resource to a directory not
under my server root?<br>
Contributed by <i>Sirilyan &lt;sirilyan@io.com></i></h2>
CERN server implemented this through the Pass directive, which let you map a
server path to an absolute path on your file system. Jigsaw uses the
org.w3c.jigsaw.resources.PassDirectory resource.

<p>COOKBOOK METHOD: Create a new resource with <i>Add resources</i> in <a
href="User/AdminTools.html">JigAdmin</a> at the location you want the new
server path to exist. Assign whatever name you desire to the new resource, and
assign <a
href="Reference/org.w3c.jigsaw.resources.PassDirectory.html">org.w3c.jigsaw.resources.PassDirectory</a>
for the class. Edit this new resource to change the pass-target attribute to
the absolute path to the directory you want to serve.</p>

<p>You may want to change the name attribute of the 'index' file in that
directory to Overview.html. name and filename are two separate attributes in
Jigsaw; this is also a poor man's (or a Win95/NT user's) symlink.</p>

<p>Serving directories outside your server root may be a security risk.</p>

<h2><a name="CGI-scripts"></a>How do I setup CGI scripts ?</h2>
They are two ways to setup CGI scripts. The manual way requires that you
describe each script to the server. Let's say your script's path relative to
the server root is <tt>WWW/cgi-bin/myscript</tt>. You will first have to
create an appropriate <a
href="Reference/org.w3c.tools.resources.FileResource.html">org.w3c.tools.resources.FileResource</a>
with a <a
href="Reference/org.w3c.jigsaw.frames.CgiFrame.html">org.w3c.jigsaw.frames.CgiFrame</a>
instance to wrap your script. See this <a
href="User/resource.html">tutorials</a> to know how to create a resource in
<b>Jigsaw</b>.

<p>Then edit the newly created resource, and setup it's command line (the
command line the server will use to run your script). Each line of the text
field should represent one argument, the first one being the script full
path.</p>

<p>You can also register files of a given extension as scripts, by using a
specialized <a href="User/indexers.html">indexer</a>.  When required, you can
even specify the interpreter to be run to execute the script (for example,
under Windows 95, or NT).</p>

<h2><a name="php3"></a>How can I use php3 in <b>Jigsaw</b> ?</h2>
This is quite easy, the best way is to do it directly using an indexer. php3
scripts will be handled as CGIs (so see the FAQ entry above).

<p>You need first to compile php3 as a cgi interpreter, then configure the
"php3" extension in your <a href="User/Indexers.html">indexer</a> using a <a
href="Reference/org.w3c.tools.resources.FileResource.html">FileResource</a>
and a <a href="Reference/org.w3c.jigsaw.frames.CgiFrame.html">CgiFrame</a>,
like aforementionned. Then, in your <a
href="Reference/org.w3c.jigsaw.frames.CgiFrame.html">CgiFrame</a>, set the
"interpreter" field to your php binary, and "Generates Form" to true.
<i>(Note, this will work with Jigsaw 2.0.2 and up)</i></p>

<h2><a name="index"></a>How do I set the default document?</h2>
With <a href="User/JigAdmin/Overview.html">JigAdmin</a> select the the <a
href="Reference/org.w3c.jigsaw.frames.HTTPFrame.html">HTTPFrame</a> (or
subclass) associated to the <a
href="Reference/org.w3c.tools.resources.DirectoryResource.html">DirectoryResource</a>
(or subclass) where you want to modify the default document. Then, set the "<a
href="Reference/org.w3c.jigsaw.frames.HTTPFrame.html#index">index</a>" field
to your default document (eg: index.html).

<p><i>Note: Don't forget to commit and save your changes</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="ssl"></a>Does Jigsaw support SSL?</h2>
There was a SSL version of Jigsaw, done at <a
href="http://jcewww.iaik.tu-graz.ac.at/">IAIK</a>. With Jigsaw 2.2.3, released
on november 27th 2003, there is a native SSL implementation 
for the HTTP and WebDAV servers.


<h2>What is the default Login Name and Password for JigAdmin?</h2>
The default Login Name is: <b>admin</b>, the default Password is:
<b>admin</b>.

<p>This information is also available in the <a
href="User/JigAdmin/running.html#auth">JigAdmin documentation</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="extend"></a>How can I extend <b>Jigsaw</b> ?</h2>
<b>Jigsaw</b> can be extended in a number of ways. Here are just three
possible things you can play with, from the simplest to the complex ones:
<ul>
  <li>Writing new resource classes and new frame classes: you may want to read
    the <a href="Programmer/writing-resources.html">tutorial</a> on this
    subject before getting any further. You can think of this as being a n
    efficient replacement for CGI scripts, although this is a much more
    powerful environment to extend the server.</li>
  <li>Writing new filter classes: if you want to experiment with specific
    authentication needs, or if you require special logging formats. A <a
    href="Programmer/writing-filters.html">tutorial</a> on writing new filters
    is also available.</li>
  <li>Hacking <b>Jigsaw</b>. Right now you can just override any of the
    <b>Jigsaw</b> classes to replace its implementation. In the future, most
    of the interesting things that you can do this way will be turned into
    specific interfaces (as is already the case for logging right now).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="persist"></a>Why does <b>Jigsaw</b> implement its own persistence
mechanism</h2>
<b>Jigsaw</b> implements its own persistence mechanism while RMI already
provides a way to serialize objects, why is it so, will it change ? What
<b>Jigsaw</b> implements in the <tt>w3c.tools.store</tt> package is more then
persistence. It provides both a way of serializing objects <i>and</i> a way of
describing what and how the object will be dumped. The available
meta-description of objects (that you can obtain through the
<tt>getAttributes</tt> method of resources), is a central part of
<b>Jigsaw</b> architecture, since it offers the ability to create generic
resource editors. This is not likely to disappear.

<p>However, <b>Jigsaw</b> persistence mechanism may be merged in the future to
the RMI interface, just by providing an implementation of the
<tt>readObject</tt> and <tt>writeObject</tt> method through its existing
mechanism.</p>

<h2><a name="client-hotjava"></a>How can I use HotJava on top of Jigsaw's HTTP
client API ?</h2>
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com/HotJava/index.html">HotJava</a> is Sun's Java
based browser. If you want to experience an HTTP/1.1 compliant browser, you
can run this browser on top of <b>Jigsaw</b>'s HTTP/1.1 compliant HTTP client
API. To do so, you need to define the <tt>java.protocol.handler.pkgs</tt>
property to <tt>w3c.www.protocol </tt>before launching HotJava. The best way
to do so is to edit the HotJava property files.

<p><b>Jigsaw</b>'s HTTP client API defines a number of other properties, if
you are planing to use this setting, you should read the <a
href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/Doc/Programmer/api/org/w3c/www/protocol/http/HttpManager.html">HttpManager</a>
documentation to get the complete list of available properties. These will
allow you to add caching, authentication, proxying and more to <a
href="http://www.javasoft.com/HotJava/index.html">HotJava</a> !</p>

<h2><a name="http-port"></a>Running <b>Jigsaw</b> on port 80 under UNIX</h2>
As of release 1.0alpha5, <b>Jigsaw</b> can now run on port 80, without running
as the <i>root</i> user. To implement that you need to install the relevant
piece of native code. This C code has been compiled and tested under Solaris,
porting it to a different platform/architecture should be pretty easy.

<p>Follow the normal installation procedure, and try to run <b>Jigsaw</b> on a
port greater than 1024. Once this work, stop <b>Jigsaw</b> (through
<tt>/Admin/Exit</tt>), Make sure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable includes the
directory containing <tt>libUnix.so</tt> (this is the <tt>Jigsaw/lib</tt>
directory under the standard release).</p>

<p>Select the user and group you want <b>Jigsaw</b> to run as. Make sure that
user has read/write access to the entire <tt>config</tt> directory. Then, you
just need to run <b>Jigsaw</b> through that special command line:</p>

<p><tt>java org.w3c.jigsaw.Main -user <i>user</i> -group <i>group</i>
&lt;other-options></tt></p>

<p>Where <i>user</i> and <i>group</i> should provide (resp.) the user and the
group you want <b>Jigsaw</b> to run as.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b>: As the underlying UNIX process will change personnality
right after acquiring the socket, the form based <i>restart</i> button
(available from the properties editor) will no longer work, since the process
will no longer be able to allocate a socket on port 80. <br>
Under such a setting, the only way to restart <b>Jigsaw</b> is to kill it
(through <tt>/Admin/Exit</tt>) and restart it manually.</p>

<h2><a name="chroot"></a>Chrooting <b>Jigsaw</b> under UNIX</h2>
As of release 1.0alpha5, <b>Jigsaw</b> can now - under UNIX - be chroot'ed. If
you try to do so, you are supposed to have some experiences with chroot'ing
programs. We will assume that you already have a correct root to run a
standard HTTP server and that you have read and understood the <i>Running
Jigsaw on port 80 </i><a href="#http-port">FAQ entry</a>.

<p>You need to install Java in that root (using whatever prefered way you
want). To install <b>Jigsaw</b>, I would recommend using the following
directory structure:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>/usr/local/jigsaw/classes</dt>
    <dd>Should contain <b>Jigsaw</b>'s current distribution <i>jigsaw.zip</i>
      class file</dd>
  <dt>/usr/local/jigsaw/extensions</dt>
    <dd>Is used to add extensions to the server while running, and should be
      included in your CLASSPATH, <i>before</i> you start <b>Jigsaw</b>.</dd>
  <dt>/usr/local/jigsaw/lib</dt>
    <dd>Should contain <b>Jigsaw</b>'s native code support  - ie
      <i>libUnix.so</i> -(to make the appropriate UNIX system calls)</dd>
</dl>
Given that (don't forget to <i>symlink</i> the real <tt>/usr/local/jigsaw</tt>
to the chroot'ed one), you should be able to reuse that script:
<pre> #!/bin/sh
# Jigsaw
# $Id: FAQ.html,v 1.1 2010/06/15 12:27:24 smhuang Exp $
# Jigsaw launcher
 
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH will be set to work *only* before chroot, by the java script
# We add here, support for PATH as they appear to be after the chroot
 
CR_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/jigsaw/lib:/usr/local/java/lib/sparc:/usr/lib:/lib
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CR_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 
# CLASSPATH needs two hacks: one to include jigsaw.zip before chroot, and
# an other one to include everything after chroot

obody -user nobody -chroot /0/w3c/abaird/sbroot -root /jigsaw</pre>

<h2><a name="Running"></a>Running Jigsaw as a NT service</h2>
To be able to run Jigsaw as a service, you may use a tool allowing java
programs to run as a service. You just have to make your choice in <a
href="http://pharos.inria.fr/Java/search?term=s1:3428">this list</a>. Remember
that the safest way to shut down Jigsaw is to use the <a
href="User/JigAdmin/">administration interface</a> of <a
href="User/jigkill.html">JigKill</a> <br>
