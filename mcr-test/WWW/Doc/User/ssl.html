Overview</a></div>
<div class="body">
<p>In the first part of the tutorial, SSL is being configured for
<b>server authentication</b>.<br>
In the second part, the SSL configuration is extended for also
providing <b>client authentication</b>.</p>
<p>SSL configuration is a two-step process. First the SSL
certificates need to be created, and then the jigsaw server needs
to be configured.</p>
<p><font color="red">Make sure that jdk 1.4.x or higher is being
used.<br>
When using jdk 1.2.x or 1.3.x, the JSSE jars must be available in
the class path.<br>
Optional client authentication or generic trust stores require at
least jdk 1.5.x.</font></p>
<p>We are going to be using the SSL implementation from Sun. Mainly
the keytool
(http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html)
is used to configure the SSL certificates. If keytool is not in
your default PATH, you can find it in the "bin" directory of your
JDK installation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a directory under jigsaw for the <b>key store</b>
keeping the server certificate, which is presented to accessing
clients</li>
<li>Run the jdk's keytool to first generate the self signed server
certificate.<br>
 In addition, the public/private key pair is generated during this
process.Example:<br>
 
<div class="box"><code>keytool -genkey -alias troi.example.com
-keypass example -keystore
/opt/jigsaw/dev/Jigsaw/keystore/troi.keystore -keyalg
RSA</code></div></li>
<li>Run the keytool again to make a certificate request. This is
what is sent to verisign or our own certificate authority. You can
skip this if you want to sign it yourself.<!--      Example:</br>
      <div class="box"><code>keytool -certreq -alias troi.example.com -keypass example -keystore
      /opt/jigsaw/dev/Jigsaw/keystore/troi.keystore</code></div>
-->
Example - specifying the output is put into a file:<br>
 
<div class="box"><code>keytool -certreq -alias troi.example.com
-keypass example -keystore
/opt/jigsaw/dev/Jigsaw/keystore/troi.keystore -file
troi.csr</code></div>
It will output something like: 
<div class="box">
<pre>      -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

</pre></div>
<p>Now we will import the response from the certificate
authority.</p>
<div class="box"><code>keytool -import -alias sis.example.com
-keystore sis.keystore -file sis.cer -keyalg RSA
-trustcacerts</code></div>
<p>and skip the next point (related to self-signature)</p></li>
<li>If you want to self-sign the certificate, you may proceed like
this:Example:<br>
 
<div class="box"><code>keytool -selfcert -alias troi.example.com
-keystore /opt/jigsaw/dev/Jigsaw/keystore/troi.keystore -keyalg
RSA</code></div></li>
<li>Create a new configuration file called https-XXXXX.props where
the XXXXX is the outside service (ex: enter.example.com). You can
copy the default http- server.props to get started</li>
<li>Edit the https-XXXXX.props file and add the following entries: 
<div class="box">
<pre>      # Points to the key store (cf. 4. above, don't forget to put the full path to the keystore)
      org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.keystore.path=
      # Supplies the password for accessing the key store ...
      org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.keystore.password=
      # Finally, the socket client factory has to be set to the SSL factory ...
      org.w3c.jigsaw.<b>http</b>.ClientFactory=org.w3c.jigsaw.<b>https</b>.socket.SSLSocketClientFactory
</pre></div>
<p>Of course you may change the default port to use the default one
for SSL: 443 (or any other you like and which is not yet used)</p>
<p>You should also change the propfile value to match the name of
your configuration file.</p></li>
<li>Edit the server.props to use the new configuration file and add
the following when creating the new server configurationExample -
note the piece in bold. That lets jigsaw know, which listener
daemon to start:<br>
 
<div class="box">
<pre>org.w3c.jigsaw.daemon.handlers=https-server|...
https-server.org.w3c.jigsaw.daemon.class=org.w3c.jigsaw.<b>https.httpsd</b>
</pre></div></li></ol>
<p>This should cover the setup requirements. You should be able to
start jigsaw and see something like the following when the start up
occurs:</p>
<div class="box"><code>Jigsaw[2.2.4]: serving at
https://troi:8002/</code></div>
<p>You can also use the secure protocol for webdav, in which case
the daemon class must be set to</p>
<div class="box">
<code>org.w3c.jigsaw.<b>webdavs.webdavsd</b></code></div>
<p><font color="blue">Server authentication enables a client to
verify in a secure way, which server she or he is talking
to.</font></p>
<i>The SUN provider uses the proprietary JKS default key store
type. When using a suitable security provider, e.g. bouncy castle,
the standard PKCS#12 key store type is available as an option. The
SUN provider also offers PKCS#12 in jdk 1.5.x.<br>
<br>
In addition, jdk 1.5.x supplies the PKCS#11 key store type for
accessing suitable hardware tokens, e.g. the eToken physical store
or other smartcard types. Hardware tokens provide a stronger level
of security by effectively preventing the private key from being
copied or stolen: <b>The private key never leaves the
token</b>.<br>
<br>
With the current Jigsaw https implementation, you can use any of
the above at your choice.</i><br>
<br>
 Note:<br>
For using <font color="red">hardware tokens</font> to store your
server certificate, you must install the PKCS#11 driver software
for your token and add the SUN PKCS#11 provider bridge to the
security configuration file of your java runtime environment
($JAVA_HOME/lib/security/java.security). 
<div class="box">
<pre>security.provider.7=sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11 ${java.home}/lib/pkcs11.properties
</pre></div>
The specified provider configuration file
($JAVA_HOME/lib/pkcs11.properties) must contain a reference to the
PKCS#11 driver of your token. The file content might look like this
(sample for eToken on a Windows system): 
<div class="box">
<pre>name = eToken
library = /WINDOWS/SYSTEM32/eTpkcs11.dll
</pre></div>
After these prerequisites (cf. the JDK PKCS#11 guide for further
details), you can adapt your Jigsaw ssl properties, i.e. you must
set your key store type to PKCS#11 and the password to the pin of
your token. The path to the key store must remain undefined, i.e.
null or blank.<br>
 
<div class="box">
<pre>org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.keystore.type=<b>pkcs11</b>
org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.keystore.password=myPin1234
</pre></div>
<p>Jigsaw also provides for <font color="blue">client
authentication</font>, which addresses the other way around: It
<font color="blue">enables a server (and a web application) to
verify in a secure way, which client accesses the server.</font>
Although, client authentication is rarely used in the web, it is a
powerful infrastructure for building secure web applications with
distributed user management.</p>
<p>For clients to be verified, they must present a certificate,
which can be checked by the server using public key
infrastructure.<br>
In order to do so, the server needs an additional <b>trust
store</b> for also keeping track of the CA certificates used to
sign client certificates.</p>
<p>Extending the SSL configuration for also verifying clients is a
two-step process again. First the trust store has to be populated
with CA certificates (at least one, the so-called "trust anchor"),
and then the jigsaw server needs to be configured.</p>
<p>You can obtain a client certificate from an authority like
verisign and store it in your browser for being presented to the
server during the SSL handshake. In this case, you also need to
import the authority's certificate used to sign yours into the
server's trust store. The latter task can be performed using
keytool again.</p>
<p>If you prefer acting as your own CA, keytool and the SUN JCE
implementation are not sufficient, because they currently do not
provide for signing certificates other than your own. However, you
can download a free JCE extension from <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/">bouncy castle</a>, which also
provides for certificate signing features. You can modify the
following sample code for playing CA:</p>
<p>Make sure that the bouncy castle bcprov-jdk14-121.jar file is in
your JRE/lib/ext directory.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>Now, being able to set up a server-side trust store keeping a CA
certificate and to import a CA-signed certificate into your
browser's certificate store, we can complete the client
authentication configuration.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a key store (named "trust store") with keytool
containing your self-signed or a true, imported CA certificate.
(cf. previous section for details)</li>
<li>Create a key store with keytool containing your own self-signed
client certificate.</li>
<li>Either sign your own client certificate with your own CA
certificate as explained above or let it sign by a true CA.</li>
<li>Import the signed client certificate into your browser's
certificate store.<br>
<br>
 Note: Browsers normally require the PKCS#12 key store type for
import.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;"><br></li>
<li>Edit the https-XXXXX.props file and add the following entries: 
<div class="box">
<pre>      # Points to the trust store (cf. 1. above, don't forget to put the full path to the truststore)
      org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.truststore.path=
      # Supplies the password for accessing the trust store ...
      org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.truststore.password=
      # Optionally, you can decide, whether to force clients (right side set to: true) to authenticate or 
      # also admit a client without successful authentication (right side set to: false), which is the default
      org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.must.authenticate=
</pre></div></li></ol>
<p>This should cover the setup requirements. When starting and
accessing a server url, you should (after server certificate
presentation) be asked to type your browser's certificate store
password, because the server wants to check your client
certificate. If this is successful or the
<code>org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.must.authenticate</code> option is set to
<code>false</code> you are allowed to continue.</p>
<p>Note, client certificates and other SSL characteristics are also
transparent to a servlet via the <code>getAuthType</code>,
<code>getRemoteUser</code>, <code>getUserPrincipal</code> methods
and the following request attributes of the servlet api:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre> javax.servlet.request.cipher_suite
 javax.servlet.request.key_size
 javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate
 
</pre></div>
<p><br></p>
<i>Finally, Jigsaw offers a <b>generic key store</b> feature, which
provides for bridging to the Java Certification Path API in order
to use PKIX standards for validating client certificates. The
feature is provided by using the key manager or trust manager
factory initialization with the
<code>javax.net.ssl.ManagerFactoryParameters</code> parameter when
the generic key or trust store flag is set to
<code>true</code>.<br>
<br>
In this case, the ManagerFactoryParameters implementation must be
supplied to Jigsaw as an arbitray Java class in the class path,
with its class name being configured as the
<code>org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.truststore.type</code> property and with
the class implementing the following method:</i> 
<div class="box">
<pre>public static ManagerFactoryParameters getInstance(String path, String password)
    throws InvalidAlgorithmParameterException;
</pre></div>
<i>The path and password parameters of the method are taken from
the respective properties of the Jigsaw key or trust store
configuration.</i><br>
<br>
 The following example shows how to use Jigsaw <font color="red">PKIX client certificate validation</font>.<br>
 
<ol>
<li>Configure a generic trust store for the
<code>foo.MyStore</code> implementation class.
<div class="box">
<pre>org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.truststore.generic=true
org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.truststore.type=foo.MyStore
org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.truststore.path=...
org.w3c.jigsaw.ssl.truststore.password=...
</pre></div></li>
<li>Make the <code>foo.MyStore</code> class available in the class
path. The corresponding Java source might look like this:
